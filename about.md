  I'm an Computer science student specialising in the Internet of Things currently in my 4th year at South East Technological 
  University (SETU).

  Some hobbies I enjoy include going to the gym, I have been interested in lifting weights since I was a teenager, I also have an interest in running, with it being one of my main hobbies at the moment. Other hobbies include reading, with my favourite genre being history. If I could go back to any point in history it would be to the Aztecs the year before  the Spanish explorerâ€™s landed to give the locals a heads up.

  Once done college, I want to do more travelling, places I want to go to include Germany, Italy and Mexico and then down into South America.
