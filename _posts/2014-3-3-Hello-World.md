title: Innovating Accessibility: An Autonomous Guide for the Visually Impaired
---

Welcome to my project blog! Here, I share insights and updates on my final year project which focuses on creating an innovative solution for visually impaired (VI) individuals.

In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that approximately 285 million people are visually impaired worldwide, with 39 million among them being completely blind. Blindness significantly affects quality of life, reducing independence for daily activities. Traditionally, guide dogs have provided immense support, enhancing mobility and independence for visually impaired persons. However, the demand for guide dogs far outstrips supply, with waiting times for a trained dog exceeding 18 months.

**Project Aim:**  
My project aims to explore a cutting-edge solution to this problem by integrating advanced robotics with artificial intelligence. The goal is to develop a viable alternative to the traditional guide dog, using Unitreeâ€™s Go2 Robot dog equipped with an AI-based object detection system. This system will enable the robot to make safe navigation decisions, particularly in complex urban environments like crossing busy streets at traffic signals.

**Commercial Potential:**  
In addition to its primary function, this project investigates the commercial potential of such autonomous guide dogs. Could they be a sustainable, effective alternative in aiding visually impaired people?
