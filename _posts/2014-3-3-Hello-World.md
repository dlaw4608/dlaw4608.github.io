title: Innovating Accessibility: An Autonomous Guide for the Visually Impaired
---

**Academic Title** 
Autonomous Robot Guide Dog 

**Commercial Title** 
C.A.R.E Canine

**Project Aim:**  
My project aims to explore a cutting-edge solution to this problem by integrating advanced robotics with artificial intelligence. The goal of this project is to offer an alternative to the traditional Guide Dog, an artificial companion that will help there partner get around safely, traversing public environments and helping to avoid any objects or potential hazards along the way. The main component of this project is the Go2, a quad pedal robot developed by the robotics company Unitree. A Custom trained Object detection model will use the Go2’s high resolution camera to detect the changing of Red to Green, and Green to Red at a pedestrian crossing. This Project is broken down into three development phases 1: Local Prototype, Partial Integration with Go2, 3: Fully integrated with Go2. Other similar autonomous guide dog projects do already exist, nearly all have one or more drawbacks that will be addressed further down in this report.

**Technology Used:**
<br>
•	Unitree’s Go2 Robot Dog
•	TensorFlow Api
•	Python
•	Docker
•	WebRTC
